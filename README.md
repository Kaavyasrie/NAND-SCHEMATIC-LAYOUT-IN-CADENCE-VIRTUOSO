# NAND-SCHEMATIC-LAYOUT-IN-CADENCE-VIRTUOSO
This repository contains the schematic, symbol, and layout of a 2-input CMOS NAND gate designed and verified in Cadence Virtuoso. The design has passed all DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout Versus Schematic) verifications, ensuring it is ready for further integration or fabrication flow.

📁 Project Contents
schematic/ – NAND gate schematic design

symbol/ – Custom symbol for schematic-level use
